# Major Project Reflection

### Description
For my project, I built browser and desktop version of a Pacman game. My aim was to make the game functionally identical to the original game, and have it look as close to the original as possible while adding new features like a custom map builder and local high-scores. 

### Important takeaway
I feel like one of my most important takeaways during the course of completing this project was understanding the importance of foresight and how important it is to universally integrate the different parts of a project together. 

### Hardest thing to do?
The hardest thing to do was definitely the ghostsâ€™ pathfinding, especially the junction generation to allow them to turn.

### How was that solved?
I solved it by rethinking the entire way the pathfinding worked, and restructuring it to something less intuitive but more efficient and integrated, which allowed me to only have to generate the junction map once when the game starts.

### What would you do differently next time?
 - A better/more detailed start screen - find a way to render the start screen in the original game
 - Modifying the audio files so they integrate better, for eg. trim the ends so any loops are continuous. 
 - Begin building the application much earlier so I could learn more about electronJS and electron-forge as I did it.
