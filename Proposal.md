# Major Project Proposal

### Description
For my major project, I'm planning to build an online/app version of Pacman. This program will essentially emulate modern, more capable versions of these games. Complete system customization and multiplayer modes for both games will also be implemented. The interface will also have multiple options to allow you to seamlessly switch between games.

### Need to have list
  - Local multiplayer capability - P2 plays as either another one of the ghosts or Mrs. Pacman?
  - Complete system customization i.e. color, shape, accents (font maybe?)
  - The game is built very similar to the original version
  - High scores
  - Play sound so it looks and feels exactly like the original game does/did.
  - Use advanced OOP so the code is as efficient and elegant as possible.
  - Looks good
  - Multiple maps

### Nice to have list
  - Looks better than just "good"
  - Randomizing maps
  - Online multiplayer?
  - Map building functions for both games
  - Also build a version with electron so it's a (downloadable) desktop application as well as a website app
  - "Cheat mode" where you automatically get all the hax
  - Online high scores to sync b/w different computers
  - Pause/settings/etc. menu
  - A coin slot/credits function thing in the main menu?
