# Major Project Proposal

### Description
For my major project, I'm planning to build a retro arcade gaming app/program. This program will include games that I've already built, like Pacman, Lunar Lander, and Atari Breakout. It will also include at least 7 "new" old-school arcade games that I will code myself. The interface will basically have multiple options to allow you to seamlessly switch between games.
 
### Need to have list
  - At least 7 games
  - At least one of the more complex arcade games (3D-style arcade game maybe?)
  - Complete system customization i.e. color, shape, accents (font maybe?)
  - The games are built exactly like the original versions
  - High scores
  - Also build a version with electron so it's a (downloadable) desktop application as well as a website app
  - Play sound so it looks and feels exactly like the original games do/did.
  - Use physics engine(s) to have the games be as efficient and elegant as possible.
  - Looks good
  
### Nice to have list
  - Looks better than just "good"
  - More than 10 games 
  - Have touchscreen compatibility?
  - "Cheat mode" where you automatically get all the hax
  - Universal high scores
  - Hardware integration to bring games out into the real world(maybe via the micro:bit?)
  - Pause/settings/etc. menu
  - A coin slot/credits function thing in the main menu?
