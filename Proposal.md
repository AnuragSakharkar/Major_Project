# Major Project Proposal

### Description
I'm going to build a retro arcade gaming app/program.
 
### Need to have list
  - At least 7 games
  - At least one of the more complex arcade games (from around the time when 3D games were getting popular)
  - Customization
  - The games are built exactly like the original versions
  - High scores
  - Built with electron so it's a (downloadable) desktop application
  - Looks good
  
### Nice to have list
  - Looks better than "good"
  - More than 10 games 
  - "Cheat mode" where you automatically get all the hax
  - Universal high scores
  - Physical integration (maybe via the micro:bit?)
