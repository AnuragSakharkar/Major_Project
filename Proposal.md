# Major Project Proposal

### Description
I'm going to build a game maybe a multiplayer FPS, in unity.
 
### Need to have list
  - Movement mechanics
  - Shooting + damage + ammo
  - Must look nice
  - Have an offline mode w/bots
  
### Nice to have list
  - Must look better than "nice"
  - Have actual character customization (colors and stuff)
